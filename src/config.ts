  aboutMe:
    "I'm Dean Jaddoe, a passionate Software Engineering student at The Hague University of Applied Sciences with a strong interest in full-stack development. My goal is building functional, user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems, working with technologies like React, ASP.NET, Python, and Docker. My projects range from a full-stack web application to a machine learning model. As a motivated learner with a problem-solving mindset, I'm constantly exploring new technologies and refining my skills, always aiming to create solutions that are both technically correct and user-centered. When I'm not coding, you'll find me at the gym or enjoying social activities with friends.",
